# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## 1. PEP 530 – Asynchronous Comprehensions

PEP 530 introduces the concept of asynchronous comprehensions, which allow for the creation of asynchronous generators using a compact and expressive syntax.

## 2. What’s New in Python: Asynchronous Comprehensions / Generators

This section explores the latest features and enhancements related to asynchronous comprehensions and generators in Python.

## 3. Type-hints for Generators

Learn how to use type annotations to specify the expected types of values yielded by generators, improving code readability and maintainability.

## 4. Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will:

- Understand how to write an asynchronous generator in Python.
- Know how to utilize async comprehensions for concise and efficient asynchronous code.
- Be proficient in type-annotating generators for improved code documentation and readability.
