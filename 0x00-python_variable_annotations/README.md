## Type Annotations in Python 3


Certainly! Below is a simplified version of the documentation:

#Type Annotations in Python 3
Type annotations in Python allow you to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. They provide a way to document and enforce the types of values used in your code, which can help improve code readability and maintainability.

#Duck Typing
Duck typing is a principle in programming that focuses on an object's behavior rather than its type. In Python, this means that you can often use objects of different types interchangeably as long as they support the same set of methods or operations.

#Validating Your Code with Mypy
Mypy is a static type checker for Python that can help you find type errors in your code. You can use mypy to analyze your code and detect potential type-related issues before running it.

#To use mypy, you need to install it using pip:


pip install mypy
Then, you can run mypy on your Python scripts to check for type errors:


mypy your_script.py
Mypy will analyze your code and provide feedback on any type-related issues it finds, helping you ensure the correctness and robustness of your code.
